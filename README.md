This project implements and visualizes L-systems, a method of generating fractal-like structures using recursive string rewriting. The code consists of three separate L-system simulations that create intricate patterns based on different sets of rules and axioms.

Files Included:
l_system_description.md: Descriptions of the L-system, its principles, and applications.
l_system_example.md: Includes various L-system code examples and the images they generate.
