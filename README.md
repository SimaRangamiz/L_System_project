L_System
This project implements and visualizes L-System (Lindenmayer System). L-System is a method for generating fractal-like structures using recursive string rewriting. This system is widely used in computer graphics, plant modeling, and the generation of complex patterns.

Features:
Three unique L-System simulations: Each simulation generates intricate patterns based on its own set of rules and axioms.
Customizable rules and parameters: Experiment with your own rules and create unique designs.
Visualization tools: View the results of the L-Systems as fractal-like images.

Files Included:
l_system_description.md: Descriptions of the L-system, its principles, and applications.
l_system_example.md: Includes various L-system code examples and the images they generate.
